# Contributing

Contributions of all kind are welcome, but will all be held to the same standard. It's important you follow the rules below so that the repository can stay consistent and clean.

## Reporting issues, requesting features

[Please use the issue templates](https://github.com/migaku-official/Migaku-Kanji-Addon/issues/new/choose) when logging new issues or feature requests; if you don't we'll probably just ask you those same questions anyway.

## Developing new features

Before you spend any effort developing any new features, please consider proposing and discussing your ideas in the the appropriate channels in the Migaku Discord server.

If you just want to dive right into the code, please read the adjacent development documentation ([DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)) to learn how this repository is structured.
