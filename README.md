## Installation

More details, and the installation code [can be found on AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1872210448). IF you want to get straight to the point - you can install the addon via the Anki menu Tools > Add-ons > "Get add-ons" button > type in `1872210448`.

Main releases and updates are managed via AnkiWeb, and so your addon will automatically prompt you for updates.

For alpha and beta releases, you can install these directly via [the releases page](https://github.com/migaku-official/Migaku-Kanji-Addon/releases), downloading and opening the `*.ankiaddon` file. No special measures are required for the retention of your user data, you can simply install it over your existing addon.

## User guide

[A video guide is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9bmWLvUBQo).

## Questions, support, issues

If you have questions or are having difficulties setting up the addon, you can talk with us directly on the Migaku Discord server (available to [Patreon supporters](https://www.patreon.com/Migaku/)) in the `#migaku-kanji-god` channel. There is also a long channel history there you can search through for common questions.

To report bugs or request features, you can do so here by [opening an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/migaku-official/Migaku-Kanji-Addon/issues). Please search issues (both open and closed) to see if your bug/feature already has an issue open for it. Voicing support for features you want to see will help us prioritise what will make it into the next release.
